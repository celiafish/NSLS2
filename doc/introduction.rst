Introduction to scikit-xray
---------------------------

Scikit-xray provides simple functions useful for X-ray science, conveniently
grouped by technique. It includes domain-specific functionality written for
this package and also relevant functions from other scientific packages such as
scikit-image. Thus, it is a complete solution, curating useful tools from the
scientific Python community and presenting them in a context for X-ray science.

There are several ways to use scikit-image. Users comfortable with Python,
IPython, or the IPython notebook can use it like any other package. Users
who prefer drag-and-drop software can access all the tools in scikit-image
through `vistrails <http://www.vistrails.org/index.php/Main_Page>`__.

Scikit-xray functions accept and return standard Python and numpy datatypes, so
they play nicely with other packages from the scientific Python community.
Further, the modular design of scikit-xray allows its components to be easily
reused in way not envisioned by the authors.
